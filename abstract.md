# Automating Reproduciblility --- Challenges and what it takes to meet them

<!--more exciting to start with the problem-->
Computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results from the same data with the same computer code.
It is a building block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about while avoiding various errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results.
But what does it take to make something reproducible?
Until recently, detailed descriptions of methods and analyses were the primary instrument for ensuring scientific reproducibility.
Such manual description has four shortcomings that get more pronounced the more central computational methods are for research.
We propose that researchers take advantage of technological advancements---version control, dynamic document generation, workflow automation, and containerization---to meet these challenges.
Our workflow enables scientists to achieve a more comprehensive standard that allows anyone to access a digital research repository and reproduce all computational steps from raw data to final report, including all relevant statistical analyses, with a single command.
