Verse 1: I'm staring at a screen, trying to make sense of it all Data's flying left and right, I can't let it fall I run the code again, just to be sure I need to know that my results aren't a blur

Chorus: It's got to be reproducible, if we're gonna make it right Computational research, it's got to see the light We can't afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We've got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment

Verse 2: I share my results with my colleagues and peers They run the code too, to see if it appears Just as I intended, with no room for error We've got to be certain, that our work is a terror

Chorus: It's got to be reproducible, if we're gonna make it right Computational research, it's got to see the light We can't afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We've got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment

Bridge: We can't let our findings be in doubt We've got to make sure that we figure it out We can't let our work be in vain We've got to make sure that our research remains

Chorus: It's got to be reproducible, if we're gonna make it right Computational research, it's got to see the light We can't afford to get it wrong, not even for a moment We've got to be sure, that our work is truly ownment

> Can you rewrite the chorus?

Sure! Here's a revised version of the chorus:

Chorus: We need reproducibility, to get our research right Computational science, it's got to see the light We can't afford to make mistakes, not even for a minute We've got to be sure, that our findings aren't fictitious

> aaron.peikert@posteo.de
> Can you improve the rhyme of the chorus?

Certainly! Here is an improved version of the chorus with rhymes:

Chorus: Reproducibility's key, to make our research complete In computational science, we can't afford to cheat We've got to be certain, that our work is rock-solid Or our findings could be invalid, it's a risk we can't sidestep

> aaron.peikert@posteo.de
> Can you make the last line rhyme?

Sure! Here is an improved version of the chorus with rhyming in the last line:

Chorus: Reproducibility's key, to make our research complete In computational science, we can't afford to cheat We've got to be certain, that our work is rock-solid Or our findings could be void, it's a risk we must avoid

(Verse 1) I was in the lab, runnin' experiments Data flying left and right, I was so intent I thought I had it all figured out But when I tried to reproduce it, the results had me in doubt

(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it's a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can't afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it's solid, like a skyscraper

(Verse 2) I learned my lesson the hard way Gotta document every step, gotta make it pay I can't afford to cut corners or take any shortcuts Gotta make sure my findings are rock-solid, no doubt

(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it's a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can't afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it's solid, like a skyscraper

(Bridge) We can't let our work be in vain Gotta make sure it stands up to the test again and again Computational reproducibility, it's the key To making sure our research is rock-solid, can't you see?

(Chorus) Computational reproducibility, it's a must If we wanna make sure our research is a plus We can't afford to leave any room for error Gotta make sure it's solid, like a skyscraper
